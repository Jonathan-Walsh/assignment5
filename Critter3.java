/**
 * Critter3 (Freddy) is fast. He likes to run.
 * He has a set square path, and makes loop after loop on the same path
 * If he encounters another Critter, he stays to fight
 *    so that the Critter is eliminated from his running path
 * Freddy will only reproduce if his child will be strong,
 *    So he waits until he can give his baby as much energy
 *    as he had when he was born
 * The baby is placed down and right so that they will not run into each other
